# Rosa 

Rosa is an open-source project to integrate AI-assistants into robots which use ROS/ROS2.

Pros:
Open Source
Well documented
Add langchain tools
Custom Prompts
gpt 3 to gpt 4 o mini integrateted custom Models? GPT 4 o recomended (price to performance) 
Llama 3.1 8b dosn't perform well 70b is in testing
Probably easy to adopt other models over langchain
